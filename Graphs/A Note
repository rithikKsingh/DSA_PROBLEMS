Similar Problems (follow common pattern):

1.  Flood Fill
    01Matrix
    Rotten Oranges
    Number of Enclaves

Do rotten oranges.

2. Number of Islands (similar to rotten oranges but you look at all the 8 directions)

3. Bipartite Graph

4. Cycle detection in an undirected graph(using bfs,dfs)

5. Cycle detection in a directed graph using dfs

6. Word ladder

7. Topo Sort (valid only for directed acyclic graph) usinf dfs

8. Kahn's Algo :  BFS topo sort.
   NOTE: same is used in cycle detection in a directed graph using BFS. You just check the number of nodes with 0 indegrees once you are 
   out of the loop where you traverse queue.
