// its better to read the description of the question because it gets difficult to understand as some restrictions come. 

/* do see these important test cases: 
1.[abc ab]   : here all characters of first and second string are same. However second string is smaller than first. Therefore it should have came before "abc". 
               So not possible to get an answer here.
2.[wrt wrtkj]  : here similar like above case. but here its possible. also since there is no difference in characters, so all are independent. 
3.["z", "z"] : both are same, so there should be atleast one node. as z can exist independently 
4.["abc"] :  single string, each character independent of each other.
